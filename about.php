                 ‘Service Before Self’ – Our motto is a vivid reflection of the mettle that goes into the making of an institution or an organization. Our motto is a constant reminder that we should serve others willingly, graciously and selflessly. We should not expect anything in return for our service because there is a greater pleasure in giving than in receiving. We believe in the saying, ‘Thy need is greater than mine’.</div>
